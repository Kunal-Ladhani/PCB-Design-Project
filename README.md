# PCB-Design-Project

In this project we designed a PCB cicuit for a Heat Sensing Device, made the PCB end-to-end using an Op-Amp (IC 741). I used EAGLE software to prepare the schematic of the PCB, printed that on a board, performed etching of the board, drilled the holes, and soldered all the circuit components onto it.
